# Facial_Keypoint_Detection

### Project Overview
In this project, computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures is used to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. Capability to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face.

### Project Instructions
- Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data
- Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints
- Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN
- Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
